A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/SomnusHermeticus/pen/zngtJ.

 Originally, a simple css challenge around recursive and semantic rules which became something more complicated than I originally intended. I have a fascination for hermeticism, alchemy and magic, so I thought I might put those in the mix and make a magic circle generator.
